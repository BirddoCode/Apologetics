this is easy, mark 10:17 , we have to go back to mark 2, because "except God alone" also appears in mark 2 IDENTITACLLY, but it said that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sin, so jesus makes himself equal with God. So, in mark 10, he said to the young man, do you understand that I am God?
because in mark 10, jesus said the last 6 law that is love your neighbor, but where is the first 4? in verse 21, jesus placed his laws to sell the treasure and follow him as THE FIRST PART OF THE LAW. 
so that's why jesus is God.
