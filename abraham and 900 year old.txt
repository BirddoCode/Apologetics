There are two more possible explanations for Abraham's skepticism of having a child at age 100.  He says that Sarah is 90 years old, but the genealogies before that only list the fathers.  We don't know how old Abraham's mother was when he was born, or the mothers of any of the others who are mentioned in the lists.  Likewise, the word "father" in Hebrew doesn't necessarily mean a literal father; it can also be used to mean "ancestor."  In other words, a grandfather, great-grandfather, great-great grandfather, etc.

the account of genesis age is symbolic because of gensis 17:17, a lot of abraham's ancestor had a baby when they're 100+ years. 
so it's symbolic. read genesis 17 i guess or genesis 5.
