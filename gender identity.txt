we're founding out who society says we are rather than finding out who we truly are. 
people only identitfying who we are by only gender identity? that's bullshit. 
only looking at sexual desire. 
we just wanted be accepted from a different group. 

None of us to perfect, but God accepted us who we are. so we don't need validation by everyone else like gender identity. 

not rlly, I only think there is 2 gender, male and female. 
cuz it's kinda pointless for me to go out of your way just to know what do you want your gender to be.
it's like you never appriciate what you are and wanna be smth else (sorta)
