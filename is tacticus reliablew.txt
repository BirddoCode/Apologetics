yes, matt think that it's only quoting what the christians believe. tactiucs is a history book. if you read the passage in context, he's clearly recording that christus suffered at pointus pilate, it says OUR prosecutors. . third, matt logic doesnt make sense because later on it's clearly anti christian passage because it calls them mischivioues and evil. if he intervied them, why would they see it'e evil?


also matt has double standards when he asked to cite a historian, he could not but when I provided cite about tactius.  he wont believe.
