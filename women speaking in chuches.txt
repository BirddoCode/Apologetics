1 cor 14:34-35 , paul doesn't mean women can't speak, cuz in 1 cor 11:5 and rome 16:1 women can speak and prophesied. 

IP interpreation said that paul quote the chorintians and answer in verse 36 (preffered one). 

another one is that, this is the specific kind of women in chorintians that supposedly doesn't wanna hear their husband and said to remain silent. cuz in the culture, women were uneducated the same way as men. when multiple people are getting word from God, others around will need to be evaluating. in the church, women tried to charm in and give their opinion if it's consisstent with scriputre, and because they did not have education , they did some chaos over the church and talk to another. so in the church, paul said if you have a specific question, you need to ask their husband. it assumes men lead our families. 

it's cultural issue cuz what if you're a single woman? you can't talk to husband
