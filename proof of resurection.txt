prove of resurection is that even the enemies of Jesus acknowledged the ressurection cuz the jews didn't publicly deny the disciples' claim and the charge that the authorities had bribed the guard to keep silent. had the charge been false, they wouldve openly denounced it.

the resurrection was that it flourished in the very city where Jesus had been pblicly crucified. SO long as the people of jerusalem thought that jesus' body was in the tomb, few would have been prepared to believe that nonsense.

the jewish authoritied would have exposed the whole affair simply by pointing jesus' tomb. 

also messianic prophecy and lord's claim testimony of persecuted followers, leading to a better understanding of the reality of our existence is more than enough for me.
