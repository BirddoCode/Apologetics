it's easy really, just find the body. if you say you cannot. 
well , alexander the great or pharoahs that are influencial got their body. or if not, johanna got the feet and nail in a box described by josephus to be crucified. 

so it's pretty easy to find, but wait, we know jesus was crucified (lol take that matt dillhanty), and wait, where's the body if you really wanna know? again it's debunkable silly.
