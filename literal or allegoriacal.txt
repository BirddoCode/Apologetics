not all that is written in the bible is metaphorical. we have to understand the cultural context. 
REMEMBER CONTEXT. ex: in luke 14:26. when it's balatanly wrong or if you didn't look at the context, it's allegorical, otherwise it's literal. ex: luke 14:26, it says to hate your mother, BUT if you look at the whole verse, it means TO BE THE DISCIPLE. it doesnt make sense logically because jesus also said to love your mother, if you think it's contradiction it's fine, but a better way of addressing it that it's allegorical, which means we just have to love jesus more, or our love to family have to be less for jesus, and in matthew 10:34-39, it's answered that ANYONE WHO LOVES THEIR FATHER MORE THAN ME cannot be a discple, so if you look at the context and other things, it will make sense. so that's why if looking at specific verse, we either have to look at context or look at scholar's interpretation. you can't just understand the "bible" entirely without cultural context. 

dalam menafsirkan alkitab, kita selalu melihat konteks sasstra, budaya masa itu, bakan ada kritik teks, justru aneh kalau ktita tafsirkan menurut kacamat akita. ini prinsip sama seperti waktu ikita baca buku, perlu tahu makna dan maksud si penulis. kita gak bisa seenaknya menafsirkan maksud si penulis maksa menurut maksud si pembaca, ini ngak fair secara keilmuan
