meh not really, because agnostic is true null hyphotesis. 
even if you think God doesn't exist because of evidence and become 'null hyphotesis', you have to give Some sort of evidence on why you think that's the case. 

ex: i dont believe alien exist (not perfect), but explain WHY and HOW it doesnt exist, at least you need some "proof" (not realisticly all the time).
