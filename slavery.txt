few notes. 


every nation has had slaves, the Bible pioneered them having rights, (it's taught that in Nt, masters shouldn't severly punish their slaves because God is both their masters). 

you couldn't traffic slaves. 

you couldn't own fellow believers (unless they had sold themselves to you, and were to be treated fairly and released after 6 years of service) and anyone could take the israelites covenant at anytime. 

the israelites were at perpetual war so it was either taking slaves or slaughtering them all. 

and most applicable to today, there are American cooperations you use daily who treate workers worse by far than israel, think of the next time you buy chocolates. eviedence if the above can be found in exodus , christians need to stop being ashamed of the bible histtory. they did what they needed to do. 

also ask alex o connor, d you think working at a company is slavery? lol 

The bible demanded that slaves be treated within a ceratin moral ground. God did not allow rape, murder nor taking wives from slaves. this was statement to the world. 

the israelites had been enslaved repeatdly themselves for disobeying God. had he said it was immoral compeletely and allowed it to happen to his own, you could argue he did an immoral thing but didn't and the way it was done keeps the bible consistent. 

christianity is also a reason slavery ends due the jesus. without christianity, here is a good chance it would still be common.moral ground chjanges often and all views are technically equal even if undesired . because no has the authority t sau wjat is truly wrong or right.
