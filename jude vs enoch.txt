Just as preachers today quote commentaries, jorunals, news periodicals, or even tv shows to frive home or illustrate a point, so the 
biblical writers use external material to draw attention and make a statement. Paul quotes from pagan greek poes
. The psalmists and prophets borrow vocabulart and paraphrase material from ancient egyptians, mesopotamian and syrian literature. Jude quotes a book from pseudepigripga. The people of biblical times knew the quoted material wasn't inspried but it had meaning for them and their audience. 

in other words, jude used enoch to drive out a point, their use of extra biblical material, doesn't require to believe or the book was inspired. like pastor quotting a movie.
