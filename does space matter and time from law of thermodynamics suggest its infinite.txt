well you could say that but there are multiple views on how the universe actually began, to say that only "one" is correct, that's stupid, like the person on the comments say about it. the fact there are multiple views on this and only choose 1 out of dozen to be the correct one, she doesnt understand science at all then. 
if you think we need to go with the latest, okay? what's the latest theory say then? does it say univesrse is infinite or have a beggining, what is it? also even if it somehow doesnt say universe doesnt have a beggining, you cannot dispute other views on it first, you have to disprove it.

and second, first law of thermodynamics only say energy cannot be created nor destroyed, okay what does that mean actually? like the energy after big bang or the energy that always been in the universe? 


if it's the second one, it still doesnt solve that infinite past is impossible by logic, so it CAN be that 1st law of thermodynamic is wrong like newton, new science can come so 1st law of thermo can be disputed by modern research. , but there are arguments againts it ofc, but still, what does actually mean that energy cannot be "created", like you could interpert in 2  different ways, that alone dispute the fact there's only 1 "correct" way. 1st is the energy cannot be created again after big bang because energy still chaging till then. and 2nd is that energy cannot be created in a scene it's always there, but again, that doesnt solve the fact infinite past is impossible. 

 like in our understanding, The First Law of Thermodynamics doesn't provide a definitive answer to the question of the universe's temporal extent; it simply asserts the conservation of energy within the universe, regardless of its age or duration.


The concept of "before the Big Bang" is a bit tricky because the Big Bang is thought to be the starting point of our current universe. Since time itself is thought to have started with the Big Bang, talking about what happened "before" becomes somewhat meaningless within the context of our current understanding of physics.

As for whether energy existed before the Big Bang, it's not clear. Some theories speculate about the existence of a pre-Big Bang state, but these ideas are highly speculative and not yet supported by empirical evidence. Our current understanding of the universe's origins is limited to what we can observe and infer from observations, and it doesn't provide a definitive answer to questions about what might have existed before the Big Bang, including whether energy as we understand it existed in some form. This remains an active area of research and speculation in theoretical physics and cosmology.


Before the Big Bang, there was no space or time as we know them, so talking about what existed or didn't exist gets a bit tricky. We're not sure if energy existed in some form before the Big Bang because our current understanding doesn't reach that far back. It's like trying to understand what's outside the edges of a map—it's hard to say because we haven't explored there yet.

Physicists think the Big Bang did. So the short answer is that the energy we encounter and use everyday has always been with us since the beginning of the universe and always will be with us. It just changes form all around us. That is called the law of conservation of energy.

The First Law of Thermodynamics doesn't directly dispute or confirm whether the universe had a beginning. It simply says that energy can't be created or destroyed, only changed from one form to another. So, whether the universe had a beginning or has always existed is a question that goes beyond what the First Law can answer.

The First Law of Thermodynamics states that energy can be converted from one form to another with the interaction of heat, work and internal energy, but it cannot be created nor destroyed, under any circumstances.


The First Law of Thermodynamics doesn't say anything about whether energy itself had a beginning or not. It just tells us that energy can't be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. So, it doesn't really speak to the origin of energy itself.The "created" part in the First Law of Thermodynamics means that energy cannot be brought into existence from nothing. It implies that energy has always existed in some form and cannot be made from scratch. However, the law itself doesn't provide information about whether energy has always existed throughout time or if it had a specific beginning point. It simply states that energy cannot be created or destroyed within the universe, but it doesn't address questions about the origin of energy itself. again context of the law is important, after it said "cannot be destroyed not created" , it then say "Energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. It can only change forms. This law is often stated as the principle of conservation of energy" , so it just means that it can only change forms but the energy itself cannot be destroyed nor created in a sense in the universe or after the big bang, so in the universe, it cannot create a whole new "other" energy different than the rest, THAT"S it, it says nothing about origin of energy. or if im wrong, it can be but doesnt change the fact universe with infinite past is impossible. 

The term "created" in the context of the First Law of Thermodynamics means that energy cannot come into existence from nothing—it must come from somewhere or be transformed from another form of energy. This idea suggests that energy has always existed in some form, but the law itself doesn't explicitly state whether energy has existed eternally throughout time or if it had a specific beginning. So, while the law implies that energy has always been around in some way, it doesn't directly answer the question of whether it has always existed throughout time.

so it can be intereperted like that, or 1st law of termodynamics is wrong if you wanna interepert as energy cannot be created in literal sense. that's it.
