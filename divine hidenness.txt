if God showed us what he truly is in person, we would never technically believe him anymore because we believe because of we are scared of hell, so technically we wont truly believe and more people will go to hell if God . 

then why God showed to some people and they go to heaven, like moses and stuff. wouldn't the would to be scared? Yes, they were scared but after knowing God and the love, they came to believe without force. God chosed them so that They can spread the message God does exist. But not everyone will do that, every person is different and to some people, if God revealed himself, some people will believe because scared until the end of time. 

so logically, if God doesn't appear to them personally, we need to use our reasoning to believe in God because that way we are not forced by God to believe him. God appeared to some people so that that "some people" can tell God exist, ofc if God doesn't appear to anyone, we can't know he actually exist or not, so people will become agnostic or athiest. so some people HAD(a must that God shpuld do) to be chosen to tell God appeared to them (ofc many gods and stuff, but we have to use comparison to know which God exist).

 Some people are chosen, yes, cuz luck maybe(or God choose them). 

can God make everyone the same to believe without fear? No, cuz free will of stuff.
