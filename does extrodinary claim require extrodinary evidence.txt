they way I see, there are a set of standards for evidence that we can set for deviding true things. whatever the standard is, it has to be consistent and without exception otherwise it's no good standard. My contention is that we actually do treat all evidence the same, but it looks like some claims need more evidence because they have more variables that need proven. Now in terms of quantity, more evidence may actually be required, but none of this evidence need to be extraordinary. i merely need account for the claim while also excluding all other counter claims. 


So if I have standard A , B and C and claim Z is proven by A and B but not C, it's not that I didn't apply C, it's simply that I che3cked for C and it was a non sequitur and I glaze over C for pratically skae unlesssomebody brings it up. If the non sequiturs were C-Z it would be silly for me to categorically name off every non squitur when I could Just ame off the proffs. so I'm not applying different standards for my evidence.
