Definition of Hyperbole:

"Exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally"

The feeding of a 5000 wasn't a collection of claims, it was the telling of a story. It doesn't class as hyperbole.

The gospels say Jesus spoke in parables. Do you understand what a parable is? I think not. Parables always full of metaphor and symbology.  It also makes sense to ask who was Jesus directing to parable to. So bothered by others belief in God when it really doesn't affect you. So many atheists say they don't care, yet clog religious channels comments trying to push your unbelief on believers.

Why are you trying to literally interpret what is obviously a metaphor? Do you literally believe there's a botanical plant that can grant you knowledge of good and evil?
